This program lets you download global and channel ttv and bttv emotes.  
It also tries to make adding them to TeamSpeak 3 as simple as possible.

## Usage
To use the emotes in TeamSpeak 3 create a ZIP file which contains the emoticons folder and move it into the gfx folder of TS3.
After that select the ZIP as your icon pack in TeamSpeak 3 and they should work.
